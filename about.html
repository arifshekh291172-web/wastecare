        <h1>About WasteCare</h1>
        <p>
            Building smarter, cleaner, and more sustainable waste
            management systems for cities and businesses.

    <!-- ================= COMPANY STORY ================= -->
    <section class="about-section reveal">
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            WasteCare was founded with a simple but powerful idea —
            waste management should be smart, transparent, and sustainable.
            Traditional systems are inefficient, data-poor, and environmentally
            damaging. We set out to change that.
        </p>

        <p>
            By combining technology, analytics, and operational expertise,
            WasteCare helps municipalities, industries, and organizations
            manage waste efficiently while meeting compliance and ESG goals.
        </p>

        <h2>About the Founder</h2>

        <p>
            WasteCare is led by a technology-driven founder with a strong
            background in software development, automation, and system design.
            The vision was born from real-world challenges observed in urban
            waste management — lack of visibility, inefficiency, and poor
            environmental outcomes.
        </p>

        <p>
            With hands-on experience in building scalable digital platforms,
            the focus has always been on creating practical, real-impact
            solutions rather than just theoretical ideas.
